## About

A terminal YouTube Music player built in Rust. Uses `yt-dlp` for extraction and `rodio` for playback, wrapped in a `ratatui` TUI. Started as a learning project, now a full-featured local music client.

## Features

### Playback
- Play/Pause, Next, Previous, Seek (±10s)
- Volume control (±1% or ±5% with Shift), persisted across sessions
- Resume playback position on restart
- Background pre-downloading of upcoming tracks (lookahead)
- Persistent download cache — cached tracks play instantly on restart
- Music-only filter (`Shift+F`) — filters tracks >5 min, toggle off for podcasts

### Search & Playlists
- Search YouTube for songs and videos
- Load any YouTube or YouTube Music playlist URL directly
- Queue management with history, delete, and clear

### YouTube Music Feed Browser
- Browse your **Liked Music** and **My Playlists** directly in the TUI — no browser needed
- **Expand any playlist** to see individual tracks and cherry-pick what to add
- Add a single track to the queue or play it immediately
- Add an entire playlist to the queue in one action
- 30-minute disk cache (`feed_cache.json`) — reopening the feed is instant
- Force-refresh with `r` to bypass the cache
- Fetches via browser cookies — no OAuth, no API keys required

### Authentication
- Browser cookie auth — Chrome, Chromium, Firefox, Zen Browser (multi-profile)
- Account switcher accessible at any time (`o` key) — switch profiles or log out
- Selected account persisted across sessions

### Persistence & Reliability
- All state files written atomically (`tempfile` + `rename`) — no torn writes on crash
- Generic `CacheStore<T>` with TTL and schema versioning for all cached data
- History, queue, download cache, playback position all survive restarts
- File permissions restricted to `0o600` (owner read/write only)

## Tech Stack

| Component | Library |
|-----------|---------|
| **TUI** | `ratatui` + `crossterm` |
| **Async** | `tokio` |
| **YouTube** | `yt-dlp` (subprocess) |
| **Audio** | `rodio` (pure Rust) |
| **JSON** | `serde` + `serde_json` |
| **Atomic writes** | `tempfile` |

> **Note:** `reqwest` is listed in the old README but is not used — all network access goes through `yt-dlp`.

## How the Feed Browser Works

yt-dlp does not support scraping the YouTube Music personalised home feed
(`music.youtube.com/feed/music`) — that page uses a private InnerTube API.
The auto-generated `RDCLAK*` mixes are session-generated and have no stable URL.

What Crusty fetches instead (both work reliably with browser cookies):

| Source | URL | What you get |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Liked Music | `music.youtube.com/playlist?list=LM` | All your liked songs |
| My Playlists | `youtube.com/channel/{your_id}/playlists` | Playlists you've created or saved |

The channel ID is extracted automatically from the Liked Music response — no
configuration needed.

---

## Known Issues

- YouTube API / yt-dlp changes can break extraction (update yt-dlp if things stop working: `pip install -U yt-dlp`)
- The YouTube Music personalised home feed (auto-mixes) is not accessible via yt-dlp
- UI may not render well in very small terminals (minimum ~80×24 recommended)

---

## Recent Changes

### Feed Browser (latest)
- Full YouTube Music feed browser (`f` key) with two-mode navigation
- **Playlist mode**: browse Liked Music and your own playlists
- **Track mode**: expand any playlist to see individual tracks, cherry-pick with `a` or play with `Enter`
- 30-minute disk cache with atomic writes and schema versioning
- Parallel fetch (liked + playlists run concurrently)
- Account switcher / logout (`o` key) accessible from anywhere

### Security & Reliability
- Atomic file writes (`tempfile` + `rename`) for all persisted state — no torn files on crash
- `sanitize_text()` strips terminal-escape sequences from all yt-dlp output before rendering
- URL allowlist validation on all feed data loaded from disk or network
- `is_safe_playlist_id()` guard on synthesised URLs

### Previous
- Persistent download cache — cached tracks play instantly on restart
- Resume playback position and volume across sessions
- Native seeking with `try_seek` (forward and backward)
- Zen Browser support (multi-profile)
- Smart download management (max 5 concurrent, lookahead pre-downloading)
