## What the hell is this?

A terminal-based YouTube music player that nobody asked for, but you're getting anyway. Built in Rust because apparently I hate myself and wanted to learn ownership and borrowing the hard way.

**TL;DR:** It's like Spotify, but worse! And in your terminal! And it uses YouTube! üéâ

**This is a Rust rewrite of a Python project** - perfect for Rust beginners who want to suffer through the borrow checker together.

---

## Why does this exist?

- ‚úÖ I wanted to learn Rust (didn't really learn it, but it compiles!)
- ‚úÖ I had too much free time
- ‚úÖ Claude helped me... or maybe helped me fuck it up (hard to tell)
- ‚úÖ Spite is a powerful motivator
- ‚ùå Nobody asked for this

---

## Features (that actually work)

- ‚úÖ Search YouTube for songs/videos
- ‚úÖ Smart caching (downloads to temp, auto-deletes after 5min)
- ‚úÖ Background pre-downloading (buffer next tracks while you listen)
- ‚úÖ Play/Pause/Skip controls (groundbreaking, I know)
- ‚úÖ Volume control (revolutionary)
- ‚úÖ Queue management with history
- ‚úÖ Progress bar that actually shows progress
- ‚úÖ Keyboard shortcuts (because mouse is for normies)
- ‚úÖ Beautiful terminal UI (beauty is subjective)
- ‚úÖ Auto-advance to next track (so you don't have to)
- ‚úÖ Download progress indicator (see what's buffering)

## Tech Stack (for the nerds)

### Python ‚Üí Rust Translation

Because everything is better rewritten in Rust‚Ñ¢

| Component | Python (Easy Mode) | Rust (Hard Mode) |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **TUI** | `textual` | `ratatui` + `crossterm` |
| **Async** | `asyncio` | `tokio` |
| **YouTube** | `yt-dlp` | `yt-dlp` (subprocess) or `rustube` |
| **Audio** | `python-mpv` | `rodio` (pure Rust) |
| **HTTP** | `requests` | `reqwest` |
| **JSON** | stdlib | `serde` + `serde_json` |
| **Errors** | try/except | `Result<T, E>` (and crying) |

---

## Installation (good luck)

### Dependencies you need:

```bash
# yt-dlp (the magic sauce)
yay -S yt-dlp

# Rust (if you somehow don't have it)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Build this bad boy:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Crusty

# Build it (grab a coffee, this takes a while)
cargo build --release

# Run it
./target/release/youtube-music-player-rust

# Or just run it in dev mode (slower but good for debugging)
cargo run
```

---

## How to use it

### Keyboard shortcuts (because GUI is overrated):

| Key | What it does |
|-----|-------------|
| `Space` | Play/Pause (like a normal media player) |
| `n` | Next track (skip that garbage song) |
| `p` | Previous track (oh wait, that song was good) |
| `‚Üë` | Volume up (TURN IT UP!) |
| `‚Üì` | Volume down (turn it down, the neighbors are complaining) |
| `‚Üí` | Seek forward 10s (skip the boring intro) |
| `‚Üê` | Seek backward 10s (wait, what did they say?) |
| `q` | Quit (escape the terminal) |
| `Enter` | Add to queue / Play selected track |

## What you'll learn (if you don't rage quit first)

### 1. **Ownership & Borrowing** (a.k.a. the borrow checker's reign of terror)
```rust
// The compiler WILL yell at you
let queue = Queue::new();
let track = queue.next(); // queue owns this now

// Borrowing (politely asking to look at something)
fn display_track(track: &Track) { ... } // just looking, not taking
```

### 2. **Error Handling** (because shit happens)
```rust
// Everything that can fail returns Result
pub async fn search(&self, query: &str) -> Result<Vec<VideoInfo>, Box<dyn Error>> {
    // Either Ok(yay) or Err(fuck)
}
```

### 3. **Pattern Matching** (switch statements on steroids)
```rust
match key_code {
    KeyCode::Char(' ') => self.toggle_pause(),
    KeyCode::Char('n') => self.play_next(),
    KeyCode::Char('q') => self.quit(),
    _ => {} // shrug emoji in code form
}
```

### 4. **Async/Await** (concurrent stuff without the headache)
```rust
async fn perform_search(&mut self, query: &str) {
    let results = self.extractor.search(query, 15).await?;
    // Do things while other things happen!
}
```

## Known Issues (a.k.a. "features")

- Sometimes YouTube changes their API and everything breaks :shipit:
- Audio might not work on some weird audio formats (not my problem)
- UI might look wonky on tiny terminal windows (get a bigger monitor)
- No playlist support yet (PRs welcome!)
- Error messages could be more helpful (working on it)

---

## Recent Improvements

### Stuff that got fixed:
- ‚úÖ No more crashes when playing tracks (finally!)
- ‚úÖ Auto-advance actually works now
- ‚úÖ Progress bar shows actual progress
- ‚úÖ Better error messages (less cryptic screaming)
- ‚úÖ Pause button doesn't break time tracking anymore

### Stuff that got added:
- ‚úÖ HTTP timeout (so it doesn't hang forever)
- ‚úÖ Audio validation (checks if file is actually audio)
- ‚úÖ Status messages (know what's happening)
- ‚úÖ Queue size display (see how deep the rabbit hole goes)

## Contributing

This is a learning project, so feel free to:
- Submit PRs (I'll probably merge them)
- Open issues (I'll probably fix them... eventually)
- Fork it and make it your own
- Judge my code (constructively, please)
- Suggest features (no promises though)

Just remember: I built this to learn Rust, not to build the next Spotify. Expectations should be calibrated accordingly ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
